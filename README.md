# Synthesizer Captstone
This is my Captstone project that I created my senior year at UNCA in 2022-2023.

It is a thick application written in java using JSwing and the Lightweight Java Game Library (lwjgl).

## Dependencies
YOU WILL NEED JDK INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER IN ORDER TO RUN IT: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

YOU NEED JDK (java development kit), NOT JUST THE JRE (java runtime enviroment)

(developed on JDK 14, so 14 or higher will work.)

## How to use
Download the project, unzip and: 

WINDOWS: just double click the jar like any other application

MAC and LINUX: run the following command in the terminal in the location of Capstone/Dist:  
Java -jar Capstone.jar

## Features
Three different waveforms that can be changed into 4 presets: Sine, Square, Saw and Triangle.

Each of these waveforms can have their tone changed, their volume changed, and can additonally be turned on and off.

There are two oscillator visualizations of the waveforms, a combined one, and a seperated one.

The main feature is the program's ability to record wav samples at all the different piano note frequencies, which can then be used in creation of Midi Instruments

Notes are played by pressing keys on the keyboard.
