# Synthesizer Captstone
## UNCA Capstone Project Benjamin Knecht

This is my Captstone project that I created my senior year at UNCA in 2022-2023.
It is a Synthesizer written in java using JSwing and the Lightweight Java Library (lwjgl).
In order to use the application simply download the dist folder, and run the Capstone jar.
YOU WILL NEED JDK INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER IN ORDER TO RUN IT. (developed on JDK 14, so 14 or higher will work.)
